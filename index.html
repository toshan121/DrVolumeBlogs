<h1> 404 Not found. :( Except if it's Anna. THEN :)</h1>

<p> There is a place of peace</p>
<p>There is a place of joy</p>
<p>A place away from loneliness</p>
<p>A place away from pain</p>
<p>That place is next to you</p>
<p>A secret garden</p>
<p>Where black and white becomes a colorful place</p>
<p>Of loving, kisses, touching, caressing,</p>
<p>There with you and only you</p>
<p>Cares of the world melting away</p>
<p>Anger and fear are not allowed</p>
<p>Prejudice cannot enter</p>
<p>A place where two hearts beat as one</p>
<p>A place where two souls are interwoven,</p>
<p>Touching the inner-place of one another</p>
<p>A place that I long to come back to again and again</p>
<p>A place of sweet abandon</p>
<p>A place next to you</p>
<p>- Rocky Stonehedge</p>
